			<h2>Juggling</h2>
			<p>So you want to learn to juggle.  Good for you!  Juggling, besides being a easy form of exercise and a great party trick, increases hand-eye coordination and balance.  It's also a gateway skill for more fun circus tricks like unicycling, stilt-walking, and fire-breathing.  It's amazing what you can learn when you start hanging with the right crowds...</p>
			<p>I learned to juggled in my freshman year of college from a professor I saw juggling outside on campus.  Jugglers are super friendly and love talking about what they do!  I introduced myself and got an invite to join in for the rest of the school year.  I got my own a set of juggling balls and clubs for Christmas that year, and by April I was teaching my dorm-mates.  Spread the love y'all.</p>
			<p>How hard is it?  If you follow the method below and practice ten minutes a day, I bet you can have the basic three ball cascade pattern down in a month.  So find (or sew!) some beanbags and let's get started!</p>
			
			<h3>Materials</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>3 bean bags</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Spherical beanbags roughly the size of tennis balls are ideal.  Having a bit of weight and some give makes throwing and catching much easier.  However, tennis balls and lacrosse balls both work as well, they're just a little less forgiving.</p>

			<h3>Step 1</h3>
			<p>Stand with legs approximately shoulder width apart.  Take one ball and toss it from your right hand to your left and back again, about head height so it passes in front of your face.</p>
			<p>Did you catch it?  Good job!</p>
			<p>Now do it again, and this time pay attention to the path that it makes through the air.  Imagine a wall about a step in front of you (or stand in front of an actual wall).  Don't let the ball bounce off the wall, keep it in a consistent plane in front of you.  Try to keep yourself from stepping forward to make a catch.</p>
			<p>Still catching it?  Excellent.  Check your height.  Is it still passing in front of your face?  Yes?  All right then, next step.</p>
			
			<h3>Step 2</h3>
			<p>Okay, so that was easy.  Let's add ball number two.</p>
			<p>Now you're going to start with one ball in each hand.  The trick with two balls is the timing.  This step happens in four steady beats.  If you rush the beats, it'll be impossible to add in ball number three later.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Beat one:</strong> Throw the ball in your left hand.</li>
				<li><strong>Beat two:</strong> Throw the ball in your right hand.</li>
				<li><strong>Beat three:</strong> Catch the ball from your left hand in your right hand.</li>
				<li><strong>Beat four:</strong> Catch the ball from your right hand in your left hand.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Got it?  Throw, throw, catch, catch.  Okay, give it a try.</p>
			<p>A bit harder, isn't it?  Don't worry, we're going to sit on this one for a while.  But first, next time you try it, reverse your starting hand.  Throw the ball in your right hand first, then the left.  Juggling is full of symmetries, and it's important to practice everything on both sides evenly.  Most of us already favor one hand or the other, but in juggling you want to be able to do every trick equally well on both sides.  This starts with building an evenly balanced three ball pattern.</p>
			<p>Okay, now keep practicing, alternating starting hands each time.  Come back when you're catching both balls 80% of the time.</p>
			<p>Great!  Before we move on, let's check a few things.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Check number one:</strong>  Are you stepping forward to catch?  Make sure your throws stay in the vertical plane in front of you.</li>
				<li><strong>Check number two:</strong>  Are both throws coming up to head height and no higher?</li>
				<li><strong>Check number three:</strong>  Are both throws landing close to the catching hand?  You shouldn't have to reach very far, much less take extra steps to make the catches.</li>
				<li><strong>Check number four:</strong>  Are you keeping the beat?  Are the catches coming in their turn on separate counts?  If not, you're either rushing yourself or your throws are uneven.  Take a minute to relax and make sure your throws are consistent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All checks passing?  Let's move on.</p>
			
			<h3>Step 3</h3>
			<p>This is where the magic happens.  Pick up the third ball.</p>
			<p>Hold two balls in your right hand and one in your left.  Now, for the first time, you're only going to throw.  Don't worry about catching any of them.  Starting with your right hand, throw one ball, then throw the ball from your left hand, then throw the second ball from your right hand.  Make sense?  Feel the beat of each throw, because our beats are only going to be based on throws now.</p>
			<p>Okay, that feels a bit silly, so now that we've felt how the start goes, let's start catching.</p>
			<p>When you start with two balls in your right hand, the first catch you make is going to be with your left hand.  Before you make that catch, you need to empty your left hand by throwing the ball that starts in your left hand.  This goes for every throw, and is at the crux of maintaining your pattern.  Each new throw is made so that you can make a catch.</p>
			<p>Your first goal is to accomplish one jug.  A jug is three throws and three catches.  Take a deep breath, then give it a try.</p>
			<p>If you caught all three, congratulations!  More likely, you had a few drops.  Not to worry!  This part takes practice.  Give it another go.</p>
			<p>When you have achieved two jugs, one starting with the right hand and one starting with the left hand, you're ready to try the continuous pattern.</p>
			<p>The key to the continuous pattern?  Don't stop.  Every throw needs a catch, don't let anything drop!  That's really all there is to it.  Good luck!</p>
